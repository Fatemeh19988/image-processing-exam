# Image Processing Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Image Processing Project! This initiative is designed to introduce you to fundamental image processing techniques using OpenCV and Python. Through this project, you will gain hands-on experience with tasks such as reading an image, converting it to grayscale, resizing it, applying a Gaussian blur, and displaying the processed images using Matplotlib. This project is ideal for both beginners and those looking to brush up on their image processing skills.

## Project Description

This project covers the following functionalities in detail:

- **Reading an Image**: The script reads an image from your desktop and prepares it for processing.
- **Converting to Grayscale**: The image is transformed into a grayscale representation and saved as `grayscale_image.jpg`.
- **Resizing the Image**: The script resizes the image to dimensions of 100x100 pixels and saves the resized version as `resized_sample.jpg`.
- **Applying Gaussian Blur**: A Gaussian blur is applied to the image to smooth out any sharp edges, and the blurred image is saved as `blurred_sample.jpg`.
- **Displaying Images**: The script utilizes Matplotlib to display the original, grayscale, resized, and blurred images for easy visualization.

## Requirements

To ensure the project runs smoothly, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- `opencv-python` - Provides a comprehensive toolkit for image processing.
- `matplotlib` - Facilitates the visualization of processed images.

These dependencies can be installed using the `requirements.txt` file provided.

## Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    
   
    ```sh
   
    git clone (<your-repository-url>)
    ```
    ```sh
   cd (<your-repository-folder>)
    ```


3. **Install the Required Libraries**:
    Use pip to install the necessary libraries:
  
    pip install -r requirements.txt
   

## Usage

Once everything is set up, you can proceed with the following steps:

1. **Prepare the Image**:
    - Ensure that your image file is named `image.jpg` and is placed on your desktop.

2. **Run the Script**:
    - Execute the script to process the image:
    ```sh
    python <your-script-name>.py
    ```

3. **View the Processed Images**:
    - The processed images (grayscale, resized, and blurred) will be saved on your desktop.
    - The script will also display these images using Matplotlib, providing an immediate visual representation.

## Examples

Here are some examples of what the processed images will look like:
